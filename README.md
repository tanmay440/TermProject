# The Homework Manager

## The one solution to the age old problem of forgetting to do all your work!

This application is to be made to help people remember what home work they have due and give them a scence of achivement regarding what they have completed. This will be achived by showing the user what work they have completed, and what they still have to do. This application is to be used by students (mostly those who have a tendency to forget their work). The makinig of this application interests me because I too, like a lot of other people, often find it difficult to remember what home work the teachers have given.
